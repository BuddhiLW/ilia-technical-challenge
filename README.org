*The deadline is 10h, 01/11/2023*

* DONE Following [[https://gitlab.com/devprodexp/nameko-devexp/-/blob/main/README-DevEnv.md][README-DevEnv]] (1)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-27 Fri> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-26 Thu>
** DONE Installation
DEADLINE: <2023-10-26 Thu> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-26 Thu>
Prerequisite:
- =conda=

You can install the dependencies and create the environment in =apt-derived= systems, like Ubuntu, running:
#+begin_src bash
bash basic-setup-and-run.bash
#+end_src

It will create the =conda= environment =nameko-devex=

#+begin_quote
To activate this environment, use

$ conda activate nameko-devex

To deactivate an active environment, use

$ conda deactivate
#+end_quote

Finally, the script will
- Create backings;
- Start the services;
- Run a simple test to see if everything run smoothly.

** DONE Running the services
*** DONE Initializing =script= after installation

*** DONE =Delete-product= rpc call (2)
In [[file:products/products/service.py][products/products/service.py]], p.38.

The idea is to receive an =id= and search it the db, then delete it.

In =gateway/gateway/service.py= - Line 77, we add a instruction sequence of steps to be followed, upon deletion call (e.g., =curl -X "DELETE"=).

It will call the method =delete=, from =products_rpc=.

If successful, the response will be to return the id from the product deleted.

#+begin_src python
@http(
    "DELETE", "/products/<string:product_id>",
    expected_exceptions=ProductNotFound
)
def delete_product(self, request, product_id):
    """Gets product by `product_id` and delete it
    """

    # ------- Delete the product
    self.products_rpc.delete(product_id)

    # Respond with the product_id -- means it was a successeful a call
    return Response(
        # ProductSchema().dumps({'id': product_id}).data,
        # mimetype='application/json',
        status=204
    )
#+end_src

We write the =StorageWrapper= method for the client,
#+begin_src python
def delete(self, product_id):
    product = self.client.hgetall(self._format_key(product_id))
    self.client.delete(product_id)

    if not product:
        raise NotFound('Product ID {} does not exist'.format(product_id))
    else:
        return self._from_hash(product)
#+end_src

Also, we increment the =delete= method, in the server, located in =products/products/service.py= - Line 33,
#+begin_src python
@rpc
def delete(self, product_id):
    self.storage.delete(product_id)
#+end_src

*** DONE Wire =delete-product= into [[file:test/nex-smoketest.sh][nex-smoketest.sh]] (2)
The command to smoketest is:
#+begin_src bash
./test/nex-smoketest.sh local
#+end_src

And thus we add these lines to the bash script, in order to cover deleting a product.
#+begin_src bash
# Test: Delete Product
echo "=== Deleting product ==="
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X "DELETE" "${STD_APP_URL}/products/the_odyssey")

if [ "${RESPONSE}" = "" ]; then
    echo "Successeful deletion"
else
    echo "Error: ${RESPONSE}"
fi
echo
#+end_src

Returns an empty body, but with =204= header.

*** DONE Wire into =perf-test= (2)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-29 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>
#+begin_src bash
./test/nex-bzt.sh local
#+end_src

In order to insert the test case, we shall modify the =yml= file digested, in order to run the *performance tests*.

Therefore, inserting the following test-case in the file =test/nex-bzt.yml= - Line 111, does the job:

#+begin_src yaml
    # 5. Delete Product
    - url: /products/${product_id}
      label: product-delete
      think-time: uniform(0s, 0s)
      method: DELETE

      assert:
        - contains:
            - 204
            subject: http-code
            not: false
            extract-jsonpath:
              product_key: $.id
              default: NOT_FOUND

              - if: '"${order_id}" == "NOT_FOUND"'
                then:
                  - action: continue
#+end_src

And, we can see that the deletion has uniform performance, as expected =O(0)=. It bumps up, by =user-quantity=, but remains constant in that level, for each =user-quantity= (*in pink*).

*** DONE Wire unit-test for this method (2)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-29 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>

Add =TestDeleteProduct= class in =gateway/test/interface/test_service.py= - Line 296

#+begin_src python
class TestDeleteProduct(object):
    def test_can_delete_product(self, gateway_service, web_session):
        gateway_service.products_rpc.delete.return_value = ""
        response = web_session.delete("/products/the_odyssey")
        assert response.status_code == 204
        assert gateway_service.products_rpc.delete.call_args_list == [
            call("the_odyssey")
        ]

    def test_product_not_found(self, gateway_service, web_session):
        gateway_service.products_rpc.delete.side_effect = ProductNotFound("missing")

        # call the gateway service to get order #1
        response = web_session.delete("/products/foo")
        assert response.status_code == 404
        payload = response.json()
        assert payload["error"] == "PRODUCT_NOT_FOUND"
        assert payload["message"] == "missing"
#+end_src

The corresponding execution passes *100%* of the time, with a deprecation warning that has nothing to do with the new =feature-implementation= and =wiring=.

The purple line gives us almost a constant speed, over time and user numbers, because it should only be porportional to the time o =access-memory= time. Which, thus, makes sense.

*** DONE Wire unit-test for this method
DEADLINE: <2023-10-29 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>

In =orders/test/interface/test_service.py=, we can add these assertions to test if the =list-orders= feature is working as supposed to.

Let's create 10 orders, first. Then, test for two things:
- Does the =list-all= method will return a list of length 10?
- Are the orders actually in the db?

#+begin_src python
@pytest.mark.usefixtures("db_session")
def test_list_all_orders(orders_rpc, db_session):
    order_details = [
        {"product_id": "the_odyssey", "price": 99.99, "quantity": 1},
        {"product_id": "the_enigma", "price": 5.99, "quantity": 8},
    ]

    for _ in range(10):
        orders_rpc.create_order(OrderDetailSchema(many=True).dump(order_details).data)

    response = orders_rpc.get_orders()
    assert len(response) == 10
    assert len(response) == len(db_session.query(Order).all())
