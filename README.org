*** DONE =Delete-product= rpc call (2)
In [[file:products/products/service.py][products/products/service.py]], p.38.

The idea is to receive an =id= and search it the db, then delete it.

In =gateway/gateway/service.py= - Line 77, we add a instruction sequence of steps to be followed, upon deletion call (e.g., =curl -X "DELETE"=).

It will call the method =delete=, from =products_rpc=.

If successful, the response will be to return the id from the product deleted.

#+begin_src python
@http(
    "DELETE", "/products/<string:product_id>",
    expected_exceptions=ProductNotFound
)
def delete_product(self, request, product_id):
    """Gets product by `product_id` and delete it
    """

    # ------- Delete the product
    self.products_rpc.delete(product_id)

    # Respond with the product_id -- means it was a successeful a call
    return Response(
        # ProductSchema().dumps({'id': product_id}).data,
        # mimetype='application/json',
        status=204
    )
#+end_src

We write the =StorageWrapper= method for the client,
#+begin_src python
def delete(self, product_id):
    product = self.client.hgetall(self._format_key(product_id))
    self.client.delete(product_id)

    if not product:
        raise NotFound('Product ID {} does not exist'.format(product_id))
    else:
        return self._from_hash(product)
#+end_src

Also, we increment the =delete= method, in the server, located in =products/products/service.py= - Line 33,
#+begin_src python
@rpc
def delete(self, product_id):
    self.storage.delete(product_id)
#+end_src

*** DONE Wire =delete-product= into [[file:test/nex-smoketest.sh][nex-smoketest.sh]] (2)
The command to smoketest is:
#+begin_src bash
./test/nex-smoketest.sh local
#+end_src

And thus we add these lines to the bash script, in order to cover deleting a product.
#+begin_src bash
# Test: Delete Product
echo "=== Deleting product ==="
RESPONSE=$(curl -s -X "DELETE" "${STD_APP_URL}/products/the_odyssey")

if [ "${RESPONSE}" = "" ]; then
    echo "Successeful deletion"
else
    echo "Error: ${RESPONSE}"
fi
echo
#+end_src

Returns an empty body, but with =204= header.

*** DONE Wire into =perf-test= (2)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-29 Sun> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>
#+begin_src bash
./test/nex-bzt.sh local
#+end_src

In order to insert the test case, we shall modify the =yml= file digested, in order to run the *performance tests*.

Therefore, inserting the following test-case in the file =test/nex-bzt.yml= - Line 111, does the job:

#+begin_src yaml
    # 5. Delete Product
    - url: /products/${product_id}
      label: product-delete
      think-time: uniform(0s, 0s)
      method: DELETE

      assert:
        - contains:
            - 204
            subject: http-code
            not: false
            extract-jsonpath:
              product_key: $.id
              default: NOT_FOUND

              - if: '"${order_id}" == "NOT_FOUND"'
                then:
                  - action: continue
#+end_src

And, we can see that the deletion has uniform performance, as expected =O(0)=. It bumps up, by =user-quantity=, but remains constant in that level, for each =user-quantity= (*in pink*).

The purple line gives us almost a constant speed, over time and user numbers, because it should only be porportional to the time o =access-memory= time. Which, thus, makes sense.

- Are the orders actually in the db?

** DONE Why is performance degrading as the test runs longer? (Q1)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-31 Tue> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>

*** Hypothesis number one - Data Structures
Analyzing the =response-time= chart over time. In this test-scenario, =time= (*t*) is directly proportional to =quantity of orders= (*No*).

We see that the operations =order-get=, =order-create= and =list-orders= seem to linearly correlate to the =quantity of orders= (*No*).

That is to say that these *search* and *insertion* algorithms employed do not represent an optimal solution, since it's well-known that both operations can be =O(log(n)=, in a balanced /binary search tree/ (BST) - which can be a python dictionary.

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1300px
[[file:doc-stuff/img/chart-execution-time-non-optimal.png]]
*** Hypothesis number two - DB-Connections overhead (*Chosen explanation*)

The session calls to connect to the database are actually accumulating over the calls. This increases, linearly-proportion to the number of calls, the overhead of the next call.

This hypothesis seems the most plausible, over the fact, and the easiest to modify.

Thus, the *solution* for fixing the performance will attack this hypothesis.

** DONE How do you fix it? (Q2)
DEADLINE: <2023-10-31 Tue> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>

*** Hypothetical Solution for hypothesis one
One solution would be to implement the same storage of data with a different *data structure*. In other words, one could solve this problem by representing the same data with a different /data structure/, so the *search* and *insertion* operations be =O(log(n))=.

Another solution would be to implement a *binary search* in the *list of objects*, instead of a linear search.

Currently, the aggregate of orders has a stored-representation of a *list of objects*.

*** Hypothetical Solution for hypothesis two (my solution)
Reading the https://docs.sqlalchemy.org/ documentation, one finds that calling the =self.db.query()= is deprecated.

And, one should opt for the following:

#+begin_src python
db = Database(DeclarativeBase)

def method(self, order_id):
    with self.db_orders.get_session() as session:
        # Operate on session here
#+end_src

This approach will diminish the number of =alive sessions=. And, therefore, diminish the call-overhead for any operation.

** DONE Fix the performance issue
DEADLINE: <2023-10-31 Tue> SCHEDULED: <2023-10-29 Sun>

In =orders/orders/service.py=, I changed the =db= instance-declaration from:

#+begin_src python
db = DatabaseSession(DeclarativeBase)
#+end_src

To:
#+begin_src python
db_orders = Database(DeclarativeBase)
#+end_src

Also, in every occurrence of:
#+begin_src python
self.db.query(Order)*
#+end_src

I wrapped the section dealing with the =db=, with instead:
#+begin_src python
with self.db_orders.get_session() as session:
    session.query(Order)*
#+end_src

*** Results
The final report can be found at: https://a.blazemeter.com/app/?public-token=OUr335F30q95J2p1NNPSeZl83TvufXg75DgE7OIKMjgTqrcKpf#reports/r-ext-6540212b57597553416121/summary

And, this is the side-to-side comparison of =get-order=, for example:

#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[file:doc-stuff/img/execution-time-comparison-get-order.png]]

The before and after, from left to right. We see the performance is now much more attached, one-to-one with the number of =hits= / =requests= at a given time, instead of accumulating over executions.
* DONE Performance Tests - Second try (4)

#+begin_quote
- Question 1: Why is performance degrading as the test runs longer?
- Question 2: How do you fix it?
- Fix the performance issue.
#+end_quote

** Q1
#+begin_quote
Why is performance degrading as the test runs longer?
#+end_quote

The issue with performance may be due to a lack of caching, in the =Orders= service, in contrast with the use of =Redis= (local-caching), in the =Products= service.

Image caption: Difference in performance =Orders= vs =Products= service calls.
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[file:doc-stuff/img/order-vs-product.png]]

Due to limited resources of a server in terms of memory and CPU, repeting a common call can become a burden on the server.

** Q2
#+begin_quote
How do you fix it?
#+end_quote

Implement some sort of caching as a wrapper/decorator. For example, using =TTL= (interal/local) or =Redis= (external).

** Q3
#+begin_quote
Fix the performance issue.
#+end_quote

In order to debug and test further =Hypothesis 2= (connection overload), as well as the =Caching Hypothesis=, we explicitly turn on =echo=True= and fine-tune =pool_recycle= in seconds.

With not much difference in performance, we also turn on =expire_on_commit= and =auto_flush=.

This all done in =orders/orders/service.py=

#+begin_src python
class OrdersService:
    name = "orders"

    DB_URIS = "DB_URIS"

    db_orders = Database(DeclarativeBase)
    event_dispatcher = EventDispatcher()
    engine = create_engine(
        config.get(DB_URIS)["orders:Base"], echo=True, pool_recycle=240
    )
    method_session = scoped_session(
        sessionmaker(
            engine,
            expire_on_commit=True,
            autoflush=True,
        )
    )
#+end_src

*** TTL decorators (caching)
Now, implementing the decorators in =orders/caching.py=. First, It was tried =TTLCache=; one decorator per corresponding method.

#+begin_src python
from nameko import config
from cachetools import TTLCache
from functools import wraps
import hashlib  # We'll use hashlib to create cache keys
import redis
import json

# Create an in-memory cache with a max size and time-to-live (TTL)
cache_co = TTLCache(maxsize=500, ttl=600)  # cache for co: Create Order
cache_get = TTLCache(maxsize=500, ttl=600)  # cache for get: Get Order
cache_list = TTLCache(maxsize=500, ttl=600)  # cache for list: List Orders


def cache_get_order(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, order_id):
        # Generate a cache key based on the method name and parameters
        cache_key = f"{func.__name__}:{order_id}"

        # Check if the result is in the cache
        cached_result = cache_get.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            return cached_result

        # If not in the cache, execute the method and store the result
        result = func(self, order_id)
        cache_get[cache_key] = result

        return result

    return wrapper


def cache_list_orders(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self):
        # Generate a cache key based on the method name and parameters
        cache_key = func.__name__

        # Check if the result is in the cache
        cached_result = cache_list.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            return cached_result

        # If not in the cache, execute the method and store the result
        result = func(self)
        cache_list[cache_key] = result

        return result

    return wrapper


def cache_create_order(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, order_details):
        # Generate a cache key based on the method name and parameters
        cache_key = hashlib.md5(str(order_details).encode()).hexdigest()

        # Check if the result is in the cache
        cached_result = cache_co.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            return cached_result

        # If not in the cache, execute the method and store the result
        result = func(self, order_details)
        cache_co[cache_key] = result

        return result

    return wrapper
#+end_src

Finally, we add the decorators in =orders/service.py=, like this:

#+begin_src python
@rpc
@cache_list_orders
def list_orders(self):
    with self.method_session() as session:
        orders = session.query(Order).all()
        data = OrderSchema().dump(orders, many=True).data

        session.close()
        return data
#+end_src

*** Result of =TTS= caching
This gave a satisfactorily solved the performance issue for =list-orders= (listing all orders).

Before adding the decorators:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 500px

After adding the decorators (=TTL=):
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1000px
[[file:doc-stuff/img/list-order-diff-pos.png]]

We note =list-orders= went from an =average-rate= of 0.229 to 0.004!


Also, the =hits/s= (+38%), =avg. response time= (-23%) and =bandwidth= (22x lower) all improved. Still, =order-get= and =order-create= didn't flinch.

Graphically, we see a smoother curve:
#+ATTR_HTML: :width 1200px
[[file:doc-stuff/img/diff-overall1.png]]
*** =Redis= decorators (caching)

Trying to solve the same way =order-get= and =orders-create=, but with =Redis= because =TTS= didn't cut it, we write these decorators:

#+begin_src python
# Create a Redis connection
REDIS_URI_KEY = "REDIS_URI"
redis_client = redis.StrictRedis(decode_responses=True).from_url(
    config.get(REDIS_URI_KEY)
)


def cache_get_with_redis(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(self, order_id):
        # Generate a cache key based on the method name and parameters
        cache_key = f"{func.__name__}:{order_id}"

        # Check if the result is in the Redis cache
        cached_result = redis_client.get(cache_key)
        if cached_result is not None:
            # If cached result exists, deserialize and return it
            return json.loads(cached_result)

        # If not in the cache, execute the method and store the result in Redis
        result = func(self, order_id)

        # Cache the result as a JSON string with an expiration time (e.g., 300 seconds)
        redis_client.setex(cache_key, 300, json.dumps(result))
        return result

    return wrapper


def cache_result_with_redis(cache_prefix, ttl):
    def decorator(func):
        @wraps(func)
        def wrapper(self, *args, **kwargs):
            # Serialize the arguments to use as a cache key
            cache_key = (

        data = OrderSchema().dump(order).data

        session.close()
        return data

*** Result caching with =Redis= and =TTL= and differences

I think that by empirically fine-tuning, it's possible to remove the bell-shaped tail of the response time, also.

The main notable difference between using =Redis= and =TTL= to try to solve this performance issue was the shape of the response-time. While =TTL= maintained the linear increase over use, =Redis= gave us a bell-curve.

*** Result of changing connection parameters

Changing connection parameters won't change overall shape of the =response-time=, but will have the effect of a sinusoidal convolution.

The magnitude of the problem, though, will remain the same, in average.

*** Final thought
I was unable to either track or implement the debugging of the =order-get= and =order-create= methods.

The most promising hypothesis is, although, the =caching=. Because of the effect it gave to =list-orders= and also it's one of the main differences in implementation in the =Orders= service and the =Products= service.
